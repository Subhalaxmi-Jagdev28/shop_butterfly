## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run the application in **two ways**:

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Pull Prebuilt Docker Images (Quick Start)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ForkMeMaybe/Dockerized-Shop-Sphere-App.git
    cd Dockerized-Shop-Sphere-App
    ```

2. Start all services using prebuilt Docker Hub images:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-pull.yml up
    ```

> üìù This option is the fastest and doesn't require you to build images locally.

---

### üî® Option 2: Build from Source (Full Local Control)

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ForkMeMaybe/Dockerized-Shop-Sphere-App.git
    cd Dockerized-Shop-Sphere-App
    ```

2. Rename the environment config file:

    ```bash
    cd backend/Shop_Sphere/settings/
    mv devv.py dev.py
    ```

3. Open `dev.py` and fill in the following placeholders with your environment variables:

    ```python
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "<your-email@example.com>"
    EMAIL_HOST = "<your-smtp-host>"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "<your-email>"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "<your-email-password>"
    RAZOR_KEY_ID = "<your-razorpay-key-id>"
    RAZOR_KEY_SECRET = "<your-razorpay-key-secret>"
    SECRET_KEY = "<copy this from common.py>"
    ```

4. Return to the root of the project and build everything:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
